This is a summary and description of Android functionality used in each of the 8 scripts.

1) battery_info.pl - https://github.com/benglard/gci_task1/blob/master/battery_info.pl 

-This script provides information and metrics on the battery of your Android device.
-Information/Metrics provided include: 
	a. battery health
	b. battery charge level (as a percent)
	c. battery plug information (unplugged? AC charger? USB?)
	d. battery status (charging? full? etc.)
	e. battery temperature
	f. battery voltage
-Android functionality used includes:
	a. Pop-up alerts with text
	b. Alerts created with a positive, negative, and neutral button where each buttton provides
	   a different piece of information on the battery (figuring out which button user clicks on).
	c. Generating battery 'events'
		=> Battery events include gathering data on the different metrics shown above

2) grade_simulator.pl - https://github.com/benglard/gci_task1/blob/master/grade_simulator.pl

-This script allows users to enter grades with their corresponding weights, and computes the
average. It also turns the average into an alphabetical grade (ex. "A" if average > 90). The code 
also allows users to text the calculated average to a friend.
-Android functionality used includes:
	a. Creating alert pop-ups to notify users of important usage information
	b. Getting user input through an input dialog
	c. Pop-up dialogs displaying results
	d. Asking user whether they would like to text their average, determining user's choice,
	   prompting user for phone number if user chooses to text, sending SMS message to provided
	   phone number

3) guessing_game.pl - https://github.com/benglard/gci_task1/blob/master/guessing_game.pl

-This script is a guessing game, in which a random integer between 1 and 100 is generated. 
The user is then tasked with figuring out the integer by guessing and seeing whether
the number he/she guessed is smaller or bigger than then the random number.
-Android functionality used includes:
	a. Pop-ups displaying usage information, information on game-play, and results
	b. Prompting the user for a number, returning feedback to the user based on inputed
	   number
	c. Continuously prompting until user guesses the correct number.
 
4) list_test.pl - https://github.com/benglard/gci_task1/blob/master/list_test.pl

-This script is as an example of creating alerts with buttons and determining 
the button the user clicked on. Since I recognized that several of the other scripts would 
include alerts with buttons, I wanted to make sure I determined the correct method of 
implementing those features, and I thus created this script as a test space.
-Android functionality used includes:
	a. Creating an alert message with buttons
	b. Determing the button the user clicks on, returning user's choice

5) palindrome_checker.pl - https://github.com/benglard/gci_task1/blob/master/palindrome_checker.pl

-This script uses a recursive algorithm to check whether a word the user enters is
a palindrome (Spelled the same backwards and fowards - ex. racecar/lionoil). 
-Android functionality used includes:
	a. Pop-ups for information/results
	b. Notification creation for important usage information
	c. Prompting and accepting user input

6) password_generator.pl - https://github.com/benglard/gci_task1/blob/master/password_generator.pl

-This script geneates a password of either random letters or numbers (depending on user's choice) 
of a length that the user provides.
-Android functionality used includes:
	a. Pop-ups for information/results
	b. Getting user input through a dialog input box
	c. Getting user input through an alert box with positive/negative/neutral buttons, 
	   determing which button user clicks on

7) quadratic_formula.pl - https://github.com/benglard/gci_task1/blob/master/quadratic_formula.pl

-This script calculates the real solutions to a quadratic equation using the quadratic
formula after a user provides the a,b, and c (coefficients of the quadratic equation).
-Android functionality used includes: 
	a. Getting user input through a dialog input box
	b. Pop-ups for information/results

8) text_shortener.pl - https://github.com/benglard/gci_task1/blob/master/text_shortener.pl

-This script shortens text using the traditional SMS messaging style.
-Examples: "be right back" => "brb" OR "laugh out loud" => "lol"
-Android functionality used includes:
	a. Pop-ups for information/results
	b. Getting user input through a dialog input box
	c. Asking user whether they would like to text their shortened message, 
	determining user's choice, prompting user for phone number if user chooses to text, 
	sending SMS message to provided phone number
